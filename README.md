# percenter

Small tool to calculate the difference between two numbers in percent.
The result can optionally be multiplied with a 3rd value.

## How to compile

Make sure you have TypeScript 1.5 or higher installed and that ```tsc``` is available in your path.
Then run:
```
git clone https://github.com/hachre/percenter.git
cd percenter
./build.sh
```

This will generate ```percenter.js``` and ```percenter.js.map```.
Afterwards open ```index.html``` in a browser.
